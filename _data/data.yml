career-profile:
  title: About Me 
  summary: |
    As a Computer Systems Engineering student with a big love and passion for technology, designing and programming, I have a great interest in mostly web 
    and frontend programming, as well as other areas such as user interface design. Being an autodidact programmer, I'm continuously learning, practicing and improving my skills and knowledge. 
    I truly thrive in environments where I'm able to share what I know and learn along my peers, since there's always more to learn about everything, specially in such an area as technology.
